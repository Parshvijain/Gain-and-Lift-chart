# Gain-and-Lift-chart
In this project, we used  Bank Marketing Dataset to predict whether customers would subscribe to a term deposit based on their profile and campaign interaction data. The analysis involved data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using multiple metrics including accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, ROC curve, and Lift chart.
This project demonstrates how data analytics and machine learning can drive smarter business decisions.
It serves as a template for building data-driven marketing strategies and can be extended to other products and campaigns within the bank.

KEY INSIGHTS
-Customers with specific job types, marital status, and successful previous campaigns were more likely to subscribe.
-The model achieved good overall accuracy but could benefit from further improvements in recall (capturing more actual subscribers).
-The Lift Chart validated that using the model for targeted marketing would be far more efficient than contacting customers randomly.
